# Home Workshop Inventory Management System
This is an inventory management system that developed using Next.js with a NoSQL mongodb backend.

Font adjustments and palette swaps are available in the footer. No user login so the demo is using a view only mongo account hardcoded with a .env variable so no adding or editing the existing items in the demo.
